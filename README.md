# 3D-gridworld-problem
 Solving a 3D Gridworld problem using Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) and Q-learning
1. Formulate a real problem as an MDP (S, A, P, R, γ).
2. Implement tabular Q-learning with ε-greedy exploration.
3. Reason about convergence criteria, exploration vs. exploitation, learning curves, and learnedpolicy
evaluation.
4. Visualize and interpret optimal maxₐ Q(s,a) value functions and policies in 3D.
